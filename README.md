# Algorithms Code in Python

## Objectives
- Categorize algorithm techniques.
- Provide detailed outline of the Algorithm techniques
    - Provide pseudo-code of the algorithm
    - Provide the code in python applying Python and OOPs concepts
    - Provide example runs

## Example Run

```bash
python3 main.py
Enter 'iter' or 'recu' choice in Binary search : iter
Enter number of elements : 5

Enter the numbers : 1 10 11 2 4

Your Array is -  [1, 10, 11, 2, 4]

Your Array when sorted is -  [1, 2, 4, 10, 11]
Enter the search number from your array : 4
Element is present and its at position 2 in the sorted array
Enter 'iter' or 'recu' choice in Binary search : recu
Enter number of elements : 5

Enter the numbers : 1 3 8 2 0

Your Array is -  [1, 3, 8, 2, 0]

Your Array when sorted is -  [0, 1, 2, 3, 8]
Enter the search number from your array : 0
Element is present and its at position 0 in the sorted array
Enter 'iter' or 'recu' choice in Binary search : exit
```

## Example of error handling

```bash
python3 main.py
Enter 'iter' or 'recu' choice in Binary search : ite

Sorry that was an incorrect input - please type 'iter' or 'recu' or 'exit' to stop.
Enter 'iter' or 'recu' choice in Binary search : rec

Sorry that was an incorrect input - please type 'iter' or 'recu' or 'exit' to stop.
Enter 'iter' or 'recu' choice in Binary search : test

Sorry that was an incorrect input - please type 'iter' or 'recu' or 'exit' to stop.
Enter 'iter' or 'recu' choice in Binary search : exit
```
