# Divide And Conquer

**Divide and Conquer** algorithm is a problem-solving strategy that involves.
- **Divide** Phase : Break the given problem into smaller sub-problems.
- **Conquer** Phase : Solve the smaller sub-problems.
- **Combine** Phase : Use the solutions of smaller sub-problems to find the overall result.

The Algorithms covered here are,
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Strassen's Matrix Multipication
- Karatsuba Algorithm
- Closest Pair of Points
